**/*
Similar structure to the star triangle.
But instead of printing "s ", it prints the value of s.
So each row prints increasing numbers starting from 1.
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5 
*/

/*
Outer loop starts from 5 and decreases to 1.
Inner loop prints * up to the value of p.
So row 1 has 5 stars, row 2 has 4, ..., row 5 has 1.
